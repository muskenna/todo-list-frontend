TO-DO list frontend using React

My goal here is to test CI/CD tasks and not React development. So I created this repo using the following tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react


**Running the app in the development mode**

From the root directory run the following command:
- to install dependencies
  `npm install`
- to start the frontend server
  `npm start`

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


**Building the app for production mode**

Run the following command 
`npm run build`
